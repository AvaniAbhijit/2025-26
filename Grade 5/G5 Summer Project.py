# Summer Project Task for Students: 
# Create an interactive drawing tool where the user can control a turtle's movement using keyboard inputs. 

# Requirements:
# 1. The program should open a 600x600 pixel window with a white background and a title: "Turtle Artist - Draw with WASD keys!".
# 2. A turtle with a blue colour, turtle shape, and a pen size of 3 should be displayed at the start.
# 3. The turtle should move 10 pixels per step when pressing the forward (W) or backward(S) keys.
# 4. The turtle should turn 90 degrees when rotating left (A) or right (D).
# 5. The pen should toggle between up and down mode when the spacebar is pressed.
# 6. The program should continuously listen for key presses to dynamically control the turtle's movement.
