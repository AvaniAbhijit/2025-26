#Task  : Inside the function write the conditional statement for following-
#If num is greater than 0, print "The number is positive."
#If num is less than 0, print "The number is negative."
#If num is equal to 0, print "The number is zero."


def check_number(num):

                        # If the number is greater than 0

                        # If the number is less than 0

                        # If the number is exactly 0
