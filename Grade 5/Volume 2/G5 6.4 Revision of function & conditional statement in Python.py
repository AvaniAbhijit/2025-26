# check_number function takes one input called num on line 10.
# Inside this function, you need to write conditional statements (if-else checks) on line 12 onwards.

# Task: Inside the function, write the conditional statement for the following-
#If num is greater than 0, print "The number is positive" on lines 8 & 9.
#If num is less than 0, print "The number is negative" on lines 10 & 11.
#If num is equal to 0, print "The number is zero" on lines 12 & 13.


def check_number(num):

                        # If the number is greater than 0

                        # If the number is less than 0

                        # If the number is exactly 0

# Call the function with the user input
