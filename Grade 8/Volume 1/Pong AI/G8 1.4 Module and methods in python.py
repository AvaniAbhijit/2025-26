# A module in Python (math & random) is a file that contains Python code,
# such as variables (pi) and methods (sqrt, factorial & randit).

# Module helps to avoid writing the same code again and again.
# Use the import keyword to bring a module into our program as on line 11 and 17.
# A method is a function inside a module that performs a specific task.

#Task 1: Uncomment lines 17 & 18. Run the code and check the output.
#Task 2: Change the values for math methods and random methods.

import math  # Importing the math module
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Using the sqrt() method to find the square root
print(math.factorial(5))  # Finds factorial (5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120)
print(math.pi) # Value of pi (3.14159...)


#import random
#print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Generates a random number between 1 and 10
