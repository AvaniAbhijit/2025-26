# Loops help to repeat instructions multiple times until a specific condition is met.
# The for loop is used when you know how many times to repeat the instructions.
# Observe the indentation of code within the for loop.

# Task 1: Run the code and observe the output. 
# Task 2: Uncomment lines no. 15 & 16, run the code, and observe the output.
# Task 3: Write the for loop to print numbers from 120 to 145 on line 17 onwards.


# repeats 10 times from 1 to 10. The last number in a range is not included.
for num in range(1, 11):
    print(num)

# repeats based on the number of letters in the string - Orchids
#for letter in "Orchids":
#    print(letter)
