**Overview of the project in Volume 1**

In this volume, we will learn Pythonâ€™s turtle module along with core Python concepts while creating a snake game. 
The turtle module in Python is a simple graphics library used for drawing and animations.

The Snake Game uses the turtle module to create a moving snake. The snake moves in four directions and grows when it eats food, increasing the score. 
The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself, resetting the score but keeping the high score.
