**Overview of the projects in Volume 1**

In this volume, we will learn Pythonâ€™s turtle module along with core Python concepts while creating a snake game. 
The turtle module in Python is a simple graphics library used for drawing and animations.

The Snake Game uses the turtle module to create a moving snake. The snake moves in four directions and grows when it eats food, increasing the score. 
The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself, resetting the score but keeping the high score.

At the end of each chapter, we have a challenge activity to help you create another game using turtle -
Paddle Ball Game - based on the concepts learned in that chapter. 
This will reinforce your learning while creating another interactive game all by yourself.
